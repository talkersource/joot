CreateUser Program
-------------------------------------------------
Introduction.

The CreateUser provides a means to create a new account, without having
to log into the JOOT server.  This allows you to set up a registration
scheme from the Web.  A simple CGI script could take in the user's account
ID and password.  The script would then use this program to create the account
at the minimum level required to log into the JOOT server.  The user is then
free to log in, using the account that was created.

Requires a JVM conforming to the 1.1 specification, or better.


Usage.

The CreateUser program is written in Java.  It must reside in the same
directory as the JOOT program.  The syntax is as follows:

  java CreateUser TopDog hamburger

A new user named "TopDog" would be created for each talker listed in the
"talkers.dat" file.  The file created would be: users/t/topdog.dat

The program is secure in that it knows the minimum level required to log into
the JOOT server.  Users get created at that level.


Exit Value.

  CreateUser exits with the following return values:

  0 - Account created
  1 - Account already exists
  2 - Invalid user name (unacceptable characters, spaces, or numbers used)
  3 - User name too short
  4 - Password too short
  5 - All other errors (memory, out of disk space, bad file permissions, etc.)
