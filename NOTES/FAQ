Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------------------------

Q: Will I need a Web browser to run a JOOT talker?
A: No.
        You will need a Java Virtual Machine and the software/hardware
	requirements mentioned in section 2.0 of the README file.

Q: Will the users need a Web browser to use the JOOT talker?
A: No.
        They can use the JOOT talker without doing a single thing differently
        than if they were using an OOT, NUTS, JATS, EW-Too, etc.  However,
	if you wish to connect to JOOT from the Web, you may wish to look
	into the Java-based ANSI Terminal:

Q: Does JOOT need lots of memory?
A: Depends.
	Sun's JVM, when run normally, preallocates 20MB of memory.  You can
	reduce this by running Java as such:
		java -oss500K -ms500K -mx1M Joot

	The more users you have, the more rooms you have, and the more
	talkers you run with JOOT will increase the amount of memory that JOOT
	uses.  There may be ways to reduce the maximum amount of memory JOOT
	allocates via command line switches to the JVM itself.

	If you find JOOT crashes for no reason, you'll have to increase the
	given numbers from 500K to 1M.  If it still crashes, keep increasing it
	by 1 (e.g., 2M, 3M, 4M, etc.) until it seems stable.

Q: Can I change the port that JOOT runs on?
A: Yes.
        Edit the "talkers.dat" file located in the joot subdirectory.  Change
        the 5000 to the new port number.  Reboot the talker.

Q: Can I create my God user from online?
A: No.
        You must logon as a "Newbie" user, log off, then edit your data
        file.  If, for example, you logged on as "TopDog", then you would
        edit the file named "nowhere/users/data/t/topdog.dat".  Change the
        word "Newbie" to "God".  While you're there, I suggest changing
        "thangalin.dat" to "Wizard" or "User".

Q: I can't find the user I created?
A: create.bat
	You may need to run the create.bat file which comes with JOOT.  Log
	in and try again.

Q: What is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
A: A JVM is a piece of software which interprets Java byte-codes.
        Imagine writing a letter to somebody in Japan: You'd have to write
        it in Japanese.  Now imagine writing that very same letter to a
        person in France: It would have to be written in French.

        Writing a program in Java is like writing the letter in English, and
        sending along an English to Japanese (English to French) dictionary
        with your letter.

        The JVM is analogous to the dictionary.  Without it, the Operating
        System can not understand the Java byte-codes (that is, JOOT).

Q: How do I get rid of having to use the period in front of commands?
A: Type: .set talkmode

Q: Why doesn't backspace work?
A: Type: .set backspace

Q: Why can't I see what I'm typing?
A: Type: .set echo

Q: Does JOOT have anything to do with OOT?
A: Yes.
        JOOT is based, for the most part, on all the ideas and code that went
        into OOT.  The major difference is that JOOT is programmed in Java,
        whereas OOT was programmed C++.

Q: Does JOOT have anything to do with NUTS?
A: No.
        Everything in JOOT was written from scratch, with a few basic
        commands stolen from OOT when possible.  It has nothing to do with
        NUTS, save the command interface beginning with the period.  (Even
        that may be changed from online.)
