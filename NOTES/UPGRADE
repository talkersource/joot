How to upgrade JOOT
-------------------------------------------------
Introduction.

  JOOT is not easy to automatically upgrade since any changes you make can
be to any aspect of the talker (room files, help files, data files, user
levels, etc.).  Writing an installation program is not a task I'm prepared
to undertake at this time.
  Instead, this file lists the general steps of what needs to be changed
in order to upgrade your talker to the latest version.


Additional Help.

  Remember to encorporate the changes for all versions, starting with your
current version and ending at the top of the file.


Explanation.

  You need to look at the NOTES/WHATSNEW file to see what has changed.  Here
is an example:

1) v1.2.2  -- April 16, 1997
2)   * .jail       puts user in Jail and allows them only to say things
3)   * .free       puts user in Main Room, with the status they had before .jail
4)   * .set talk   changes having to type "." before a command or not
5)   * .system     displays system information to users; and more info. to sysops
6)   * .bansite    now can do hard-bans on a site (NOBODY gets in)

7)   * Strings (46, 363, 364, 369-378)
8)   * Help Files (samesite, set, set_logons, set_logoffs, set_talkmode, bansite,
                   set_picture, system, version)
9)   * Bug Fixes (.tell, .wizcast, .examine, .link)
10)  * RESOLVE_DNS_FOR_IP config.dat option

Line 1 indicates what the latest version is, and the date it was either
released to the public, or privately tested.  The numbering scheme used
for versioning is as follows:

  v1.2.2
   . . .
   | | |
   | | +---> Bug fixes, new commands, documentation changes
   | +-----> Public/Private releases
   +-------> Extensive Revisions

Lines 2 through 6 tell of new commands.  These are added into the file
"nowhere/data/commands.dat".  They need to be added into your own talker's
commands.dat file to be recognised by the talker.  If they are genuinely
new commands, then you can update your commands.dat then issue a ".load
command" command within the talker.  Otherwise, if they are bug fixed
or modified commands (such as .set on line 4), you will have to shutdown
your talker and reboot.

Line 7 shows which entries have been added to (or changed in) the
"nowhere/data/strings.dat" file.  They need to be added (or changed) into
your own talker's strings.dat file to be recognised by the talker.  In
this case, you need only update your own strings.dat and issue a ".load
string" command within the talker.  It is recommended you reboot.

Line 8 means that the corresponding help files have been updated, added,
or changed.  They are located in the "nowhere/help" directory and each
have an extension of ".hlp".  Thus to add the new "samesite.hlp" file,
all you have to do is move it from the "nowhere/help" directory over to
your own talker directory.  Help are re-loaded each time they are viewed.
This means that once you copy the file, it can be used by people without
having to issue a ".load" command.  No rebooting required.

Line 9 is just to point out that certain commands have had some unwanted
features removed.

Line 10 indicates that a new option has been added to
"nowhere/data/config.dat".  Take a peek at the file to see what your own
config.dat file is missing.  Make the appropriate changes, then issue
a ".load config" command from within the talker.  More information on these
options can be found in Appendix A of the README file.

If you make all the changes at once (which is the most likely scenario),
you will want to reboot the talker.  If you reboot the talker, there is
no need to issue any of the ".load" commands.  The ".load" command should
be used if you've changed your strings.dat, macros.dat, commands.dat, or
abbrs.dat from offline.  It is recommended that you use the ".tabbr" and
".string" command for changing talker abbreviations and strings, respectively.

*NEVER* change levels.dat from offline.  Use the ".levels" command from online.

In general, it is a good idea to remove the files and directories for
the "Talker" subdirectory, and then copy (or move) the new version's
"Talker" subdirectory structure.  You will need to reboot for the changes
to take effect.

This assumes you have a basic working knowledge of your operating system.
That is, you are able to move directories/files around, and edit files without
(much) trouble.
