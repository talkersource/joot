JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

1.0  Introduction
-------------------------------------------------
The following section details information that is in no way critical to get
JOOT up and running.  Most of you may just want to skip on to the next
Section.  If you already have JOOT running, skip on down to Section 3.

This documentation assumes that the command character is the period (dot).


1.1  What is JOOT?

	JOOT is a talker.  That is, a program which allows people to use
their computers to "talk" with other people.  Anybody, anywhere in the
world, who has access to an Internet Telnet client is able to use a talker.

	Talkers are typically text-based programs.  That means you don't
get to hear the other people you are "talking" with, but rather see what
they type.

	As well, talkers operate in real-time.  The moment you press the
Enter key, the other person using the Talker gets to see it.  That,
of course, is an idealistic statement: It takes time for the text to
traverse the Internet.

	Lastly, talkers provide people with "virtual" rooms and commands
to help facilitate (and/or control) the environment.


1.2  Where did JOOT come from?

	Talkers are not an original idea of mine.  I had used them for
quite some time before I decided to write my own.  When I did get around
to writing one, I wound up with OOT.

	OOT was written in C++ by myself and parts by Ken Savage.  The
commands and feel were based on other talkers I had used.  OOT was a
fresh start.  One of the few from-scratch talker codes out there.  Most
are based on NUTS.

	JOOT is a progression along OOT's evolutionary path.  The design
to OOT was extremely verbose compared with most talkers, however there
were some flaws and limitations.  The design, for the most part, has been
carried from OOT to JOOT.


1.3  Why Java?

	Aside from the flaws and limitations of OOT's design (and the design
of other talker codes), the C++ language was not built specifically for
networked applications.  Java, on the other hand, was created with networking
in mind.

	C++ does not have the verbose functionality pre-packaged into it that
Java does.  Not having to worry about releasing memory that was allocated is
a very big boon.  Platform independence is another.



-------------------------------------------------
JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

2.0  Requirements
-------------------------------------------------
The following section denotes the System Requirements you need in order
to run JOOT.


2.1  Software

	Operating System
	----------------
	SunOS, Solaris, OS/2, Linux, MacOS 7.5.5, Windows NT, Windows 95,
	AIX, and any other Operating System that has a Java Virtual Machine.

	Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
	--------------------------
	Any JVM that implements the 1.1 specification, or better.
		Kaffe - http://www.kaffe.org
		Sun 1 - http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html
		Sun 2 - http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/index.html
		Sun 3 - http://www.blackdown.org (Linux Port)
		MRJ   - http://devtools.apple.com/mrj

	Note:	The MRJ will only work on 68030 and better machines, and
		all PowerPCs.


2.2  Minimum Hardware

        RAM: 6MB
        HD : 2MB (without JVM; 6MB with JVM)
        CPU: 486-66

	I recommend at least 10MB of available RAM for running JOOT.



-------------------------------------------------
JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

3.0  Data Files
-------------------------------------------------
This section details all the major data files used in JOOT as well as what
to be aware of when editing them.  These files, unless otherwise specified,
reside in your talker's data/ subdirectory.


3.1  abbrs.dat

	This file contains the default abbreviations a user gets when she
logs on for the first time.


3.2  banned.dat

	This file contains the names of all the sites that JOOT will not
accept new users logging in from.

	NOTE: Any user that already has an account created with your talker
may continue to use the account, regardless if coming in from a banned site
or not.  The exception to this is hard banning.  See "ban.hlp".


3.3  commands.dat

	This file contains the names of all the commands, and defines two
other things.  The first is the level required to use the command.  The second
is a mapping that JOOT uses to execute the command the user typed.

	You may change the name of the command.  You may change the level
required to use the command.  You should NOT change the Class mapping that
JOOT uses in the last column (unless you know what you're doing).  The
results are unpredictable--JOOT may generate an error and cease to operate.

	An example commands.dat file looks something like that shown
in Figure 3.3.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Name = afk           Level = Newbie      Class = AfkCmd
Name = abbr          Level = User        Class = AbbrCmd
Name = beep          Level = User        Class = BeepCmd
...                  ...                 ...
Name = who           Level = Newbie      Class = WhoCmd
Name = with          Level = Newbie      Class = WithCmd
Name = wizcast       Level = Wizard      Class = WizcastCmd
---------------------------------------------------------------------
		Figure 3.3.1 - Example commands.dat file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Where each command is listed in the file is very important.  For
example, if the user typed: ".w", JOOT would interpret this to mean the
user wishes to use the ".who" command.  Had the user typed: ".wi", JOOT
would interpret this to mean the user wishes to use the ".with" command.
Finally, had the user typed: ".wiz", JOOT would interpret this to mean the
user wishes to use the ".wizcast" command.

	What you should understand from the last paragraph is that when
a user abbreviates a command, JOOT searches from the top of the file to
the bottom, looking for a command name which partially (or wholly) matches
what the user typed.  The first one JOOT finds is the one that gets executed
for the user.

	By moving lines around you may alter the expected behaviour which
users have become accustomed.  Be careful.


3.4  config.dat

	This file contains information about commons behaviours of talkers
that a SysOp may wish to change.  You may also use the ".config" command to
alter the configuration values.

	WARNING: Correctly spell all names of levels IN FULL when changing
a setting which requires a level name.

	See Appendix A for further explanation on each line.


3.5  levels.dat

	This file contains talker-specific information about levels.  Every
user has a level.  It is the level factor which decides, for the most part,
if a user is allowed to execute certain commands.  For example, it might not
be desirable to have new users able to shut down the talker.

	WARNING: Do not edit this file from the shell.  Use the ".levels"
command to add, remove, and/or rename levels.


3.6  macros.dat

	This file contains lists of pseudo-commands that all users have
access to and all users (that are logged in) may execute at any given time.

	These are also known as socials.  A big advantage to macros in JOOT
is the ability to customise your talker to suit the users.  No two talkers
have the exact same command-set.  To clear your private mail, some talkers
have the command ".cmail".  Others assume you wish to delete your private
mail, and hence have a ".dmail" command.

	By using talker macros, you can have the best of both worlds.  Merely
create a macro named ".dmail" and have it simply execute the ".cmail" command.
Listed in the file as shown in Figure 3.5.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
dmail .cmail *
laugh ; rolls onto the floor in a quivering mass of chuckle.
laugh ; laughs at what * said.
autonewbie .h rules||.desc has read the rules.||.smail TopDog Hi!  I'm new!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 3.6.1 - Example macros.dat file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	The * gets replaced with whatever the user typed in AFTER the command
itself.  For example, typing: ".dmail 1,2" results in the command of
".cmail 1,2" being executed.

	The two laugh macros are possible based on this principle.  By typing
".laugh" without anything after the command, JOOT knows to use the first
macro listed.  By typing ".laugh you", JOOT knows to use the second macro
listed.  For example:

	User Types: .laugh
	Result is : User rolls onto the floor in a quivering mass of chuckle.

	User Types: .laugh you
	Result is : User laughs at what you said.

	Common macros include ".think", ".sing", ".wink", and ".laugh".

	The last macro listed is a special talker macro.  It gets run
whenever a user of the level "Newbie" logs onto the system.  For each
user level you have, you may make a macro with "auto" prefixing the name
to be executed each time a user of that level logs in.  This is handy
for forcing people to read important messages.


3.7  roomlink.dat

	This file contains the room to room mappings for the talker.  It
is this file which JOOT uses to give names to rooms.  That is, it will
take the first spelling of the room from the first occurrence found in this
file.

	The first four entries have a specific order and meaning.  Figure
3.7.1 shows a sample roomlink.dat file (note the lack of quotes).

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Logon Limbo
Main Room
Jail
Temporary Room
Link Room
Main Room > Temple Of Doom
Temple Of Doom > Ark Room
Ark Room = Hallway
Graceland
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 3.7.1 - Example roomlink.dat file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	The first room listed represents the first room that the user sees
upon connection.  Appropriately called "Logon Limbo", although you can change
the name to anything you like (see section 4.0 below on naming rooms).  The
second room listed represents the second room that the user sees after a
successful login.  The third is where a user goes when arrested (problem
users).  The fourth room is where a user goes when the room that user is
in gets deleted.  The fifth room is where, optionally, users that link in
from another talker will wind up.

	The next line in the file shows that from the "Main Room" a user is
able to go to "Temple Of Doom".  Unless, of course, "Temple Of Doom" is locked.
Again, the next line shows that a user can go from "Temple of Doom" to the
"Ark Room".  The second last line is short-hand.  A user can go from the "Ark
Room" to the "Hallway", and from the "Hallway" to the "Ark Room".  The last
line indicates that there is a room called "Graceland" somewhere in the system
but it is not adjoined to any other room.  (Hence you must "warp" there.)

	The ".build" command can be used to update the roomlink.dat for you,
while you're online.  For more help, view the build.hlp file.  One point to
mention, however, is that when you delete a room, only the roomlink.dat
changes.  The file which represents the room does not get deleted.  This must
be done from offline.


3.8  strings.dat

	This file contains a listing of almost all the strings that JOOT
has available to it.  Figure 3.8.1 shows an example segment from a typical
strings.dat file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Enter your name: 
1. ^2Enter your Password: 
...
217. ~5%u could not be invited, %w.
218. ~2%w has invited %u to %r.
219. ~5%u is already in %r, %w!
...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 3.8.1 - Example strings.dat file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	The format of each line is very important.  Each line starts with
a number.  The number is followed by a period then a single space.  After the
space comes the string that gets displayed when the corresponding event
occurs.  Never change the numbers themselves.

	In Figure 3.8.1, for example, the 0th line gets displayed when the
user connects to the talker.  It may be helpful to note that there is in
fact a space at the end of both the 0th and 1st lines.  This space (although
not shown) moves the cursor one space away from the colon.

	Line 218 has %w, %u, and %r on them.  Figure 3.8.2 shows a list of
all the field indicators and what name gets substituted into them when the
string is used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
%d - User description
%l - Level name
%n - Generic Number
%r - Room name
%s - Generic string
%u - User name
%w - Wizard name
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 3.8.2 - strings.dat field indicators
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	%d is shown whenever the user logs into the talker, out of the talker,
or in the listing of users the ".who" command shows.
	%l is shown at the times when the name of a level is used.  This can
happen during user promotions, demotions, changing a room's settings, and so
forth.
	%n is shown at the times when a numerical result is found.  This can
happen whenever a command is issued that does some sort of counting.
	%r is shown at the times when a room name is used.  This happens more
often than not it seems.
	%s is a generic string that is used whenever the aspect that should
be displayed doesn't logically fall into one of the other field indicators.
Typically it is used for when a user says something.
	%u is either the user that issued a command, or the user name that
a command was issued on.  The latter ties into %w.
	%w is used when a command was issued on another user.  If User A
issues a command on User B, then %w always represents the name of User A,
and %u represents the name of User B.  Thus "Wizard Name" should be taken
with a grain of salt.

	If this is somewhat foggy, I suggest playing around with the
commands to figure out which does what, and which is used where.  Additionally,
strings can be changed from online using the ".string" command.  For more
information on this command, see the string.hlp file, and Appendix B.

JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

4.0  Room Files
-------------------------------------------------
This section deals with how the room files are set up.


4.1  Name Mangling

	In JOOT, the room names listed in the roomlink.dat file undergo
a simple name mangling.  Any non alpha-numeric characters get removed,
and spaces get replaced with underscores.  Additionally, all upper-case
characters are converted to lower case.

	Thus if you had a room in your roomlink.dat called "Sysop's #1 Room",
the file name you would have to give to corresponding room file name would be
"sysops_1_room".  From online, everybody would see the room as what gets
listed in the roomlink.dat file ("Sysop's #1 Room").


4.2  Location

	Your roomlink.dat file is within the talker/data directory.  The
room files themselves, however, are in the talker/rooms directory.


4.3  Format

	Each room has the format shown in Figure 4.3.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Access = Newbie
Buffer = 20
Clear = User
Echo = User
Lock = Newbie
Read = Newbie
Review = Newbie
Say = Newbie
Topic = Newbie
View = Newbie
Warp = Newbie
Wipe = Wizard
Write = User
<desc>
~5After coming through the ether known as Logon Limbo, you find yourself
~5somewhat light-headed, but amidst a friendly crowd.  Relax in the knowledge
~5that you aren't Somewhere, aren't Nowhere, but are here.
</desc>
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 4.3.1 - Room file format
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Each line with an equals sign (=) specifies the level required to
perform an action related to the room the user is in.

	"Access" controls general access to the room.
	"Buffer" is the number of public "says" that the room remembers. 
	"Clear" controls who can clear the public "says".
	"Echo" controls who can echo/review echos.
	"Lock" controls who can lock (or unlock) the room.
	"Read" controls who can read room's message board.
	"Review" controls who can read the room's buffer of "says".
	"Say" controls who can speak/emote.
	"Topic" controls who can change the room's topic.
	"View" controls who can see the room.
	"Warp" controls who can get to the room if it isn't adjoined.
	"Wipe" controls who can erase messages from the room's message board.
	"Write" controls who can write to the room's message board.

	Additionally, a room may have a description.  The description is
typically shown when the user moves (or gets moved) from one room to another.
It is bracketed by <desc> (meaning the beginning of the room's description)
and </desc> (meaning the end of the room's description).  Notice that each
line of the room's description has a ~5 before it starts.  This is the
colour indicator for dark cyan.

	Since JOOT has no ".load rooms" command (as OOT did), the alternatives
are to:

	* use the ".build" and ".rset" commands from online; or
	* make changes to the room file(s), shut the talker down, and reboot


4.4  Message Board Encryption

	All message boards in JOOT get encrypted for additional privacy.



-------------------------------------------------
JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

5.0  User Files
-------------------------------------------------
This section deals with the format of the user files.


5.1  Location

	The user data files can be found in the joot/talker/users directory:

		users/abbr/a     to users/abbr/z
		users/commands/a to users/commands/z
		users/data/a     to users/data/z
		users/macros/a   to users/macros/z
		users/people/a   to users/people/z
		users/profile/a  to users/profile/z
		users/record/a   to users/record/z
		users/sent/a     to users/sent/z
		users/smail/a    to users/smail/z

	The abbr directories store abbreviations.
	The commands directories store granted and revoked commands.
	The data directories store settings, passwords, sites, etc.
	The macros directories store macros.
	The people directories store a user's friends and enemies.
	The profile directories store profiles.
	The record directories store the text a user saw after using .record.
	The sent directories store smail that the user sent to another user.
	The smail directories store smail received from another user.

	WARNING: The sent directories and smail directories should not
be linked together using the Unix "ln" command.  This is because sent
smail and received smail files both end in ".sml".



-------------------------------------------------
JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

6.0  Installing, Running, and Configuring JOOT
-------------------------------------------------
This section deals with the steps required to install, run, and configure JOOT.

Regardless of your Operating System, the Java Virtual Machine needs to be
told where to find "Joot.class".  The environment variable CLASSPATH should
point to the current working directory as well as the all important classes.zip
file.  Here are examples for Unix and Windows, respectively:

	CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/bin/java113/lib/classes.zip

	CLASSPATH=.;c:\jdk113\lib\classes.zip


6.1  Get a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

	JOOT runs using version 1.1 of any JVM, or better.

	As JOOT is a text-based Java application, you do not need compatibility
with Sun's AWT (Another Windowing Toolkit--provision for doing graphics).


6.2  Windows 95/NT

	The following steps should help you to install JOOT (note that you
need PKZIPW to extract the files):

	* Open the File Manager
	* Select the directory where you downloaded JOOT
	* Run PKZIPW on the JOOT Zip file
	* Extract the files to C:\JOOT
	* If you used WinZip32 instead of PKZIPW run the "create.bat" file to
	  create directories which don't get extracted from the archive (a
	  known bug in WinZip)

	The following steps should help to get JOOT running:

	* Bring up a DOS Window
	* Change to the directory where you unpacked JOOT (C:\JOOT)
	* Type the following command:
		start java Joot

	  OR if you installed the JRE (which is smaller than the JDK):

		start jre -cp . Joot

	That should start the JOOT Talker Server as a background process.  As
it is not a registered Windows Service, the process will most likely terminate
when you log out of your account.  If "java" is not in your PATH, you will
have to either execute it directly, or add it to your PATH.


6.3  Unix

	The following steps should help you to unpack JOOT:

	* Change to the directory where you downloaded JOOT
	* Use "gunzip" to uncompress the JOOT .tgz (or .tar.gz) file
	* Use "tar -xvf" to unarchive the JOOT .tar file

	The following steps should help to get JOOT running:

	* Change to the directory where you unpacked JOOT
	* If you are using Sun's JVM, type the following command:
		nohup java Joot &
	  OR
		./joot

	* If you have installed Kaffe, type the following command:
		nohup kaffe Joot &
	  OR
		./joot

	If you use the "./joot" command, you may have to edit the file itself.

	That should start the JOOT Talker Server as a background process.  You
may log out of your account.


6.4  Macintosh

	The requirements for the Macintosh that I have thus far are:

	* You must be using System 7.5.5 to run Java Applications

	* From Eric Paulson (eric@house8.com):

	"First you need to get the Java Software developers kit if you want
to create a Java application for the Macintosh.  A Java process has to be
started in order to run a Java application.  This is a simple tool which
accompanies the MRJ SDK called JBinder.  It will create what is called an
envelope which starts the JVM and runs the application within it.  You just
drop the class file (Joot.class) onto the JBindery appliaction.  Specify the
source of the other class files and also set an application creator type.
From here just follow the directions which accompany the MRJ SDK and save the
application into the same directory as all the class files.  Now you have a
clickable Macintosh Java application."

	Many thanks, Eric!



6.5  Connecting to JOOT

	No specific telnet client is required to connect to JOOT.  ChamTel,
EWAN, Windows Telnet, TUT, GMud, ZMud, TinyFugue, Mac Telnet, and Unix
telnet can connect up to JOOT talkers.

	There is also a Java Applet which is a compatible Telnet Client.  You
can use this on your Talker's homepages to allow connection from the Web
itself.  It has been tested with Netscape 3.01, Netscape 4.0, and Internet
Explorer 3.02, AppletViewer, and HotJava.  Dubbed an "ANSI Emulator", it is
available at:

-------------------------------------------------
JOOT: The Java-based Object-Oriented Talker
-------------------------------------------------

7.0  Talker Linking
-------------------------------------------------
This section deals with how to link your JOOT talker to another JOOT talker.


7.1  Talker Data File

	The first file you will want to modify is your "talkers.dat" file.
Initially it looks like:

	NAME=Nowhere DIR=nowhere PORT=5000 LINK=5001

	The NAME portion specifies what your talker is named.  When linked,
the first three letters will be used to indicate the information coming from
the remote talker.  The DIR portion indicates what directory your talker
information can be found.  This allows you to specify multiple talkers without
running JOOT multiple times.  The PORT portion specifies the main port that
JOOT runs on.  This is the port that people will connect to via Telnet
programs.  Lastly, the LINK portion specifies the port that other JOOT
talkers must connect to in order to link up to your talker.


7.2  Talker Links Data File

	The second file you want to modify is your "links.dat" file in the
"data" subdirectory.  The "links.dat" file has the format shown in Figure
7.2.1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
IN=TalkerX PASS=talkerXpassword
OUT=TalkerY PASS=nowherePassword DNS=nowhere.com LINK=5001
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                Figure 7.2.1 - links.dat file Format
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	The first line shows that the talker is accepting incoming links
from "TalkerX".  The password TalkerX must use is "talkerXpassword".  Any
talker you wish to link into you must be informed of its talker-specific
link password.  This ensures that you don't have rogue talkers linking
up to you without your permission.  Case is sensitive on talker passwords.
Thus "TalkerXPassword" is not the same as "talkerXpassword".

	The second line shows that the talker has an outgoing link to
"TalkerY".  The password "nowherePassword" must be discussed (privately)
between the System Operators of both talkers.  The DNS portion indicates
the host name for TalkerY.  Lastly, the System Operator of this talker
must be informed of TalkerY's link port (usually given at the same time
as the password is discussed).


7.3  Security Issues

	A linked user must already have an account on the remote talker
that she wishes to link to.  That is, you cannot link to a talker you
haven't been to via normal telnet at least once.

	A linked user can only do commands on the remote talker that she
would have access to if normally logged in there.  This means that if
she is a God on Talker A and a User on Talker B, the only commands she
can do on Talker B are User commands.

	A banned site usually means that all accounts from that site
have been removed (nuked).  Since linking requires that you have an
account on the remote talker _BEFORE_ you can link to it, banned users
cannot get into your talker from a link.

-------------------------------------------------

Appendix A - config.dat file
-------------------------------------------------
This appendix briefly explains what each line in the config.dat file means.

MAX_USERS_ONLINE
	Number of users simultaneously online (maximum of 254).

MAX_TELL_BUFFER
	Number of tells remembered per user (per session).

MAX_SHOUT_BUFFER
	Number of shouts remembered by the talker.

MAX_WIZCAST_BUFFER
	Number of wizcasts remembered by the talker.

MAX_BROADCAST_BUFFER
	Number of broadcasts remembered by the talker.

MAX_USER_PROFILE_LINES
	Number of lines in a user's profile.

MAX_USER_MACROS
	Number of macros a user may have (talker is unlimited).

MAX_USER_ABBRS
	Number of abbreviations a user may have.

MAX_SENT_SMAILS
	Number of sent smails remembered per user (across sessions).

MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
	Login attempts allowed before user is disconnected.

MIN_ALIAS_LENGTH
	Minimum length for a user's name (always need at least 1 character).

MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH
	Minimum password length required.

MIN_LOGIN_LEVEL
	Login level required to enter the talker.

MIN_LEVEL_SAVE_USER
	Login level required to have user data file saved.

MIN_LEVEL_WIZARD
	Displays more information to a user this level or higher in the
	".examine" command.

MIN_LEVEL_WHO_WIZARD
	Displays a * beside the name of any user this level or higher in
	the ".who" command and ".with" command.

MIN_SHOW_CUMULATIVE_TIME
	Level required to see another user's cumulative time.

LINK_INTO_LINK_ROOM
	If a user that links into your talker should go to the Link Room, or
	into the Main Room.

MOVE_USER_ON_FREE
	When a jailed user has been freed, if this option is on, the user is
	moved from the Jail room into the Main room.

SAVE_GRANT_AND_REVOKE
	If this option is set to on, it saves the command(s) you grant or
	revoke from a particular user across sessions; otherwise the command is
	only valid until the user logs out.

BROADCAST_DEMOTE/BROADCAST_PROMOTE
	Should demotes/promotes be shown to everybody?  [on/off]

RESOLVE_DNS_FOR_IP
	Should DNS be sought from IP address?  [on/off]

INITIAL_USER_SETTINGS
	Use this to change what options are set for users that log into the
	talker the first time.  To alter it, log into JOOT as a new user,
	either promote that user or grant that user the ".set" command.  Log
	out, and copy the first number shown in said user's ".dat" file.

	For example, let's say you logged into the talker as "BottomDog".
	You would use the ".set" command to alter BottomDog's settings, then
	log out (ensure BottomDog's file was saved; see MIN_LEVEL_SAVE_USER).
	View the contents of the file:
		nowhere/users/data/b/bottomdog.dat

	Be sure to substitute the name of your own talker for "nowhere".  You
	should see something like:

		BottomDog
		Ui0NBJiWAfo=
		- a Newbie.
		Newbie
		508343224	<-- INITIAL_USER_SETTINGS for config.dat
		867965258078
		localhost
		... etc ...

	Replace the number in your config.dat file with the number shown on
	the fifth line (the first number in the bottomdog.dat file).

COMMAND_CHAR
	Character to indicate the start of a command.  If you change this,
	be sure to update the help files accordingly.

at the moment.  If somebody would like to undertake this monumental task, I'd
really appreciate it (that is, adding a few words for extra clarification).
